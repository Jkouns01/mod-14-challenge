<h1> AS A developer who writes about tech <br>
I WANT a CMS-style blog site <br>
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions </h1>

<p> In this lession I was able to grasp the concept of models but nothing else really. I am working on finising this course but its looking like web dev is not a carreer path for me. I am proud of how far I've come. Hopefully everything looks decent.</p>
